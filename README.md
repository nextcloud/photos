## 🚀 Installation

In your Nextcloud, simply enable the Photos app through the Apps management.
The Nextcloud Photos app is included in Nextcloud 18 and higher.

Optional add-ons that make the Photos app even better:

* Install [Recognize for Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/recognize) for AI-powered automatic face and object recognition. Includes automated tagging/categorizing.
* Install the [preview generator](https://github.com/rullzer/previewgenerator) if pre-generating thumbnails is desired.
* Install [Imaginary](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/server_tuning.html#previews) to speed up preview generation.

## Mobile Photos

Use the Android/iOS App to view your photos. It's possible to auto-upload them.

## 🏗 Development setup

This app requires the [Viewer app](https://github.com/nextcloud/viewer) to be installed and enabled.
Follow its development setup and then continue here.

1. ☁ Clone this into your `apps` folder of your Nextcloud.
2. 👩‍💻 In a terminal, run the command `make dev-setup` to install the dependencies.
3. 🏗 Then to build the Javascript whenever you make changes, run `make build-js`. To create a pull request use `make build-js-production`. Watch changes with: `make watch-js`.
4. ✅ Enable the app through the app management of your Nextcloud.
5. 🎉 Partytime!
6. 💻 Fix easily linting issues with `npm run lint:fix`.

### Adding new tests
To ensure quality of this app we use both unit tests, PHPUnit tests on the backend and Vitest unit tests on the frontend, and end-to-end tests.

When adding new features at least an end-to-end test for the feature should be added, some documentation on how to do so can be found [here](./tests/playwright/README.md).
